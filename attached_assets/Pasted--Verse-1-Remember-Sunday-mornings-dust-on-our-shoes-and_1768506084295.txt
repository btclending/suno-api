[Verse 1]
Remember Sunday mornings, dust on our shoes and knees
Chasing shadows 'round that old church swing, beneath the rustling trees
Brianna, you were fire, a light I couldn't ignore
My best friend on that playground, knew I wanted something more
We built our little kingdoms, secrets whispered low and deep
Never thought that little boy, a lifetime's promise he would keep

[Chorus]
And that smile of yours, still makes the whole world fade away
Like nothing else exists, from dawn until the close of day
You’re my everything, my anchor, my sweet song
The only one, my Brianna, I've wanted to grow old with all along

[Verse 2]
Then came that night, beneath the stars, by the creek bed's bend
Our hands brushed close, a silent signal, where our childhood had to end
The first time that we kissed, felt like my breath just went away
My heart pounded like a drum, hoping you would forever stay
Years flew by, a blur of dreams, building this life we know
Watching our own little ones, planting seeds, helping them to grow

[Chorus]
And that smile of yours, still makes the whole world fade away
Like nothing else exists, from dawn until the close of day
You’re my everything, my anchor, my sweet song
The only one, my Brianna, I've wanted to grow old with all along

[Bridge]
Watching you with our kids, it fills me up with pride
The way you nurture, teach, and always gently guide
You're still that girl from the playground, just with wisdom in your eyes
My beautiful Brianna, a love that never dies
More than a wife, more than a friend, you're the rhythm of my heart
The greatest mother, darling, right from the very start

[Chorus]
And that smile of yours, still makes the whole world fade away
Like nothing else exists, from dawn until the close of day
You’re my everything, my anchor, my sweet song
The only one, my Brianna, I've wanted to grow old with all along

[Outro]
So here's to forever, my Brianna, my dear
Happy Anniversary, my love, chasing away every single fear
I will love you till my last day, that's a promise true
I love you more, yeah, I love you more, forever and through.
